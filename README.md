## Technical details

### Front end

State is managed using `react-redux`. The `store` provided by `redux` is made up of the following slices: 

- `roomSlice`
  - handles room ID, whether the room is full, selected board, and the random emoji that shows in the title
- `opponentBoardSlice`
  - handles when opponent hides emojis
- `gameLogSlice`
  - handles game log
- `playersSlice`
  - handles whether player picked their emoji yet

There is a correspondence between action types and server events, i.e.,  
`room/roomJoined`↔`client:room/roomJoined`,`server:room/roomJoined`.

### Back end

The game logic layer runs on a `node.js` instance. Player picks are stored server side. The server groups client sockets into rooms using `socket.io` and emits game events exclusive to that room. Game state is stored in the `roomHashTable` at this layer.  
The data access/service layer is managed with `mongoose` and the controller layer is managed with `GraphQL`.  When the game ends, data from the `roomHashTable` is stored in a `mongodb` collection called `games` in the `guesstimoji` database. Here is an example document in the `games` collection:
```json

	"_id": "LvvuCjDyYUsQEBC5AAAE1MqglVjwr86Z4UK4AAAF1",

### Running locally
In the root directory, run `npm install` in both the `client` and `server` directories. The server requires a local instance of `mongodb` running on port 27017. You must have a database named `guesstimoji` with a collection named `games`. In the `client` directory, run:
```shell
npm start
```
in both the `gameApi` and `graphQlApi` directories, run:
```shell
nodemon server
```

### Deployment
The website and APIs are served with `.service` unit files in the `/etc/systemd/system` directory. The website is served with this:
```
[Unit]
Description=HTTP Web Server
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
Type=simple
ExecStart=/var/www/html/serve.sh
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
where `serve.sh` is:
```
#!/bin/bash
cd /var/www/html/build
serve -n -l 80
```
The game logic API is started with this:
```
[Unit]
Description=HTTP Game Logic API
After=network.target

[Service]
User=tommy
Environment=GAME_API_PORT=5000
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/html/gameApi
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node server.js
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
The GraphQL API is started similarly.
